# CSC615-StartYourMotors

This is the first of a two part assignment. In this first part you will control a motor.  The motor should stop, go forward, backward, as well as speed control (Pulse Width Modulation).

You will also use a Button, and the purpose of the button is to start your program.  So, you will run your program and it will wait until the button is pressed.  Once it is pressed, then you will show the motor running forward for at least 2 seconds, then slow down to 15% gradually, then stop the motor for at least one second, then start the motor slowly and gradually increase speed to max but in reverse (backwards).

See the PDF in the repository here (or iLearn for more details).
